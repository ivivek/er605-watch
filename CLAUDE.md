# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Bash tooling that SSHes into a **TP-Link Omada ER605** router, drives its
interactive Dropbear CLI, and reports dual-WAN status + connectivity. There is no
build/test framework — these are standalone scripts. Verified only on **ER605 v2.0,
firmware 2.3.0**; parsing is matched to that firmware's exact text output.

## Scripts

- **`er605-watch`** — the main tool (the repo's command). Reports per-WAN
  status/IP/gateway/DNS and pings each WAN's gateway + a public IP. `--trace`/`-t`
  adds a (slow) traceroute.
- **`probe_cli.sh`** — dev tool. Dumps the *raw* output of arbitrary CLI commands
  using the older `sleep`-paced driver (+`sshpass`). Use it to discover the command
  grammar / output format on a new firmware before touching parsers.
- **`debug_expect.sh`** — dev tool. Times each step of an `expect` session to locate
  stalls.

## Running

```bash
cp .env.example .env && chmod 600 .env   # set ROUTER_IP, ROUTER_PASS
./er605-watch                            # ~13s
./er605-watch --trace                    # + traceroute (~30-60s; slow on dead hops)
ROUTER_IP=... RPASS=... ./probe_cli.sh "show arp" "show system-info"
ROUTER_IP=... RPASS=... ./debug_expect.sh
bash -n er605-watch                      # syntax check (only "test" available)
```

Config precedence (high→low): **CLI flag (`--host <ip>`, password arg) > inline env
var > `.env` file**. `er605-watch` uses `expect` (no `sshpass`); the two dev tools
still use `sshpass`. Requires `expect`, `ssh`, and (`sshpass` for the dev tools).

## The ER605 CLI — non-obvious constraints that shape all the code

Everything here exists to work around this device. Do not "simplify" these away:

1. **Dropbear offers only the legacy `ssh-rsa` host key.** Every ssh invocation
   needs `-o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa`, or
   modern OpenSSH refuses to connect.
2. **No SSH exec mode.** `ssh router "show arp"` does *not* run the command (prints a
   `Match mac success` banner and exits). The CLI must be driven interactively over a
   PTY (`ssh -tt`).
3. **Commands return non-zero exit codes even on success.** Never judge success by
   `$?` — judge by whether a prompt came back / SSH transport (255 = real failure).
4. **No readiness signal.** `er605-watch` uses `expect` and waits for the `#` prompt
   after each command (no blind `sleep`s). The legacy `probe_cli.sh` instead paces
   with `sleep`s, which is why it can truncate slow output (bump `DELAY=`).
5. **`enable` is required** to reach the privileged `#` prompt; the base `>` prompt
   only offers `help/exit/enable/disable`.
6. **No clean EOF on logout.** After `exit`, the router never sends EOF — `expect eof`
   would block the full timeout (~30s/session). `run_cli` sends `exit` then `close`s
   the connection from our side. Keep this; it's the single biggest perf factor.
7. **`ping`/`tracert` take only an IP** (extra args → "Too many parameters") and
   follow the routing table — they cannot be bound to a WAN. So per-WAN health is
   tested by pinging *each WAN's own gateway* (egresses only that link); a public IP
   tests overall internet via the active route.

## `er605-watch` internals

- **`run_cli "cmd" ...`** — the heart of it. An `expect` heredoc (`expect -f -`,
  config passed via `EXP_*`/`CLI_CMDS` env vars) that logs in, `enable`s, sends each
  command waiting on `#`, then `close`s. Returns the full raw session text. The
  `expect` blocks use the simple single-pattern form (`expect "#"`) — the multi-arg
  `expect { -re {..} {..} timeout {..} }` form mis-parses here, so don't reintroduce it.
- **Parsing** is screen-scraping: `extract "$RAW" "<cmd>"` slices the output block for
  one command (between its `#<cmd>` echo and the next prompt); `get_field "$block"
  "<label>"` pulls a value from the `Field.....Value` (dots/colon separator) format.
- **One vs two SSH logins:** if `WAN1_GW`/`WAN2_GW` are set, shows + pings run in one
  login; left blank (the default), gateways are auto-discovered from `show interface
  switchport`, costing a second login. Either way it warns on live-vs-config drift.

## Conventions

- **No site-specific values in tracked files.** Router IP/password/gateways live only
  in `.env` (git-ignored — note `.gitignore` matches `.env` exactly, not `.env*`, so
  `.env.example` stays tracked). The history was deliberately rebuilt to be IP-free;
  keep it that way.
- Commits are authored as `Vivek K <vivek.oss@linetra.com>` (the `ivivek` GitHub
  account). Remote `origin` pushes over **HTTPS** as `ivivek`; the local SSH key
  authenticates as a *different* account, so SSH push won't work for this repo.
- When adapting to other Omada gateways (ER7206/7212PC/8411): the driver carries over;
  expect to adjust `WAN*_PORT`, the switchport range, and possibly field labels —
  re-verify formats with `probe_cli.sh`. Switches/EAPs use a different CLI entirely.
